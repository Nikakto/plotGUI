# plotGUI
GUI for matplotlib.pyplot.
Used:
+ PyQt4
+ pyperclip
+ matplotlib
+ numpy

Saved default functions of matplotlib.plot (just more user friendly) and add:
+ copy/delete/paste objects (line, circle, rectangle, arrowPatch, text)
+ drag&drop for patches (circle, rectangle, arrowPatch, text)
+ wheel zoom
+ context menu for axes and objects
+ saving by file dialog (no any settigns like DPI)

// Code is very bad. Sorry.

For edit legend:
1. RBM on axes
2. Legend on
3. RMB on object
4. Set legendary
5. Set lable
6. ...
7. Profit
