# plotGUI
GUI for matplotlib.pyplot.
Used:
+ PyQt4
+ pyperclip
+ matplotlib
+ numpy

Saved default functions of matplotlib.plot (just more user friendly) and add:
+ copy/delete/paste objects (line, circle, rectangle, arrowPatch, text)
+ drag&drop for patches (circle, rectangle, arrowPatch, text)
+ wheel zoom
+ context menu for axes and objects
+ saving as file by file dialog

// Code is very bad. Sorry.

For edit legend:
1. RMB on object
2. Set legendary
3. Set lable
4. ...
5. Profit
